					"<p><strong>ADJUST DOSE:</strong> Coadministration with bupropion may increase the plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by CYP450 2D6 (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; tricyclic antidepressants; some beta blockers, antiarrhythmics, and antipsychotics). The mechanism is decreased clearance due to inhibition of CYP450 2D6 activity by bupropion. Approximately 93% of Caucasians and more than 98% of Asians and individuals of African descent are extensive metabolizers of CYP450 2D6 and may be affected by this interaction. In a study of 15 male volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP450 2D6, administration of a single 50 mg dose of desipramine following treatment with bupropion 150 mg twice daily increased the desipramine peak plasma concentration (Cmax), systemic exposure (AUC) and half-life by an average of 2-, 5-, and 2-fold, respectively. The effect was present for at least 7 days after the last dose of bupropion. A case report describes a 4-fold increase in plasma levels of imipramine and its metabolite, desipramine, in a 64-year-old woman following the addition of bupropion 225 mg/day. Plasma levels of desipramine were increased twofold more than the imipramine levels, which is consistent with the fact that desipramine is primarily metabolized by CYP450 2D6 while imipramine is also metabolized by other CYP450 isoenzymes. In another report, an 83-year-old woman became unsteady, confused, and lethargic following the addition of bupropion SR 300 mg/day. Her nortriptyline level was found to have increased by 185%. A later rechallenge prompted recurrence of the interaction. Likewise, a 62-year-old woman with no history of seizures developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in association with toxic trimipramine plasma levels following the addition of bupropion 300 mg/day. No further seizures occurred following dosage reductions of both drugs." +
					"<strong><p>MANAGEMENT:</strong> Caution is advised if bupropion must be used concomitantly with medications that undergo metabolism by CYP450 2D6, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic range. Concomitant medications should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range. Clinical and laboratory monitoring may be appropriate for some drugs whenever bupropion is added to or withdrawn from therapy.";

These drugs may increase the risk of hypoglycemia by enhancing insulin sensitivity (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, fibrates, ginseng); stimulating insulin secretion (salicylates, disopyramide, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, quinidine, quinine, MAOIs, ginseng); decreasing insulin clearance and resistance (4-aminoquinolines); increasing peripheral glucose utilization (SSRIs, insulin-like growth factor); inhibiting gluconeogenesis (SSRIs, MAOIs, insulin-like growth factor); slowing the rate of gastric emptying (amylin analogs); and/or suppressing postprandial glucagon secretion (amylin analogs).

There have been isolated reports of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias occurring in patients treated with SMX-TMP intravenously. However, a causal relationship has not been established, and the risk of clinically significant QT prolongation is unlikely at recommended dosages of SMX-TMP. In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). In addition, the extent of drug-induced QT prolongation is dependent on the particular drug(s) involved and dosage(s) of the drug(s). Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope.";

In approximately 20% of patients in both groups, there were either changes from baseline QTc of greater than 30 msec or end-of-treatment QTc values exceeding 450 msec.

The mechanism of this interaction is unknown; however, it has been theorized that the immunosuppressive properties of corticosteroids and the potential effect on T-cell function may decrease the efficacy of ICIs. In a retrospective study in patients with advanced NSCLC (n=640), oral or intravenous corticosteroid use at doses of at least 10 mg prednisone equivalent per day at the time of or within 30 days of starting PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with either pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, or durvalumab (n=90) was associated with decreased response and overall poorer outcomes, compared to those who received and discontinued corticosteroid treatment prior to commencing PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. However, it is difficult to determine whether the corticosteroid use had unfavorable effects on patients starting ICI blockade or if corticosteroid use reflected a subgroup of patients with poorer prognosis. Significantly, the use of corticosteroids to manage immune related adverse effects after starting immune checkpoint blockade therapy has not shown negative effects on outcome survival or time to treatment failure."+
					"<p><strong>MANAGEMENT:</strong> The manufacturers' product labeling should be consulted for specific recommendations. If clinically possible, the use of systemic corticosteroids (>=10 mg prednisone equivalent/day) should be avoided at the time of or within 30 days of starting therapy with an ICI, e.g., durvalumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, cemiplimab, or atezolizumab. Corticosteroids may be used for the treatment of immune-mediated reactions after starting an ICI.

Published studies have generally reported no significant effect of olanzapine on QTc interval, although both QTc prolongation and QTc shortening have also been reported. There have been a few isolated case reports of QT prolongation in patients receiving olanzapine.
