                Diabetes drug metformin could stop gum disease and aid healthy aging
            </h1>

            <p>  Type 2 diabetes has become one of the most widespread health conditions worldwide. While medications can help people manage their symptoms, some medical experts suggest that lifestyle changes, such as following a low-calorie diet, can reverse this chronic condition. But are such changes always sustainable?</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Although gum disease occurs in the mouth, previous research shows it can affect health in other parts of the body, such as the heart and bones.</li>
                <li>Researchers from King’s College London recently found that metformin —a common type 2 diabetes drug—may help improve clinical outcomes for non-diabetic people with gum disease.</li>
                <li>The same study also found that metformin may help prevent bone loss caused by either periodontal disease or aging via both mouse and clinical trials.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Also known as gum disease, this condition occurs when the tissues holding teeth in place become infected. If left untreated, periodontal disease can damage bones in the mouth and ultimately lead to tooth loss.

                Periodontal disease can also impact other areas of the body. Previous studies link gum disease to an increased risk for cardiovascular diseaseTrusted Source, Alzheimer’s diseaseTrusted Source, diabetesTrusted Source, and respiratory diseaseTrusted Source.
            </p>
            <p style="background-color:powderblue;">Now, researchers from King’s College London have found a common type 2 diabetes drug may help improve clinical outcomes for non-diabetic people with gum disease, as well as help prevent bone loss caused by either periodontal disease or aging, via both mouse and clinical trials.</p>


            <h1 class="w3-text-teal"> Using metformin to treat gum disease </h1>
            <p>
                For this study, Dr. Vitor Neves, academic clinical lecturer, periodontology registrar in the Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences at King’s College London, and lead author of this study, and his team focused on using a common type 2 diabetes drug called metformin.

                Previous studies have looked at the anti-inflammatory propertiesTrusted Source of metformin to provide protection against conditions like cardiovascular diseaseTrusted Source, liver diseaseTrusted Source, and certain types of cancerTrusted Source.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is also not the first study to look at metformin as an ‘anti-aging’ therapy. Research published in August 2019 found there is mounting evidence suggesting the drug offers beneficial effects in reducing the risk of aging-related diseasesTrusted Source.

                A study published in April 2021 says metformin reduces the levels of AGEsTrusted Source — a marker of aging — by lowering insulin and blood glucose levels and increasing insulin sensitivity.
            </p>


            <h1 class="w3-text-teal"> Metformin helps control inflammation  </h1>
            <p style="background-color:powderblue;">First, the researchers tested metformin in a mouse model of periodontal disease. After the mouse study, scientists found metformin led to significant prevention of bone loss during induced periodontal disease and age-related bone loss in living mice. </p>
            <p>“What surprised me about metformin was being able to make my aging animals healthier and (prevent) 50% of bone loss,” Dr. Neves told Medical News Today. “When I analyzed that data, it was the (first) time I felt, ‘Wow, there is really something here’.”</p>
            <p>Next, Dr. Neves and his colleagues performed a clinical trial with 20 study participants who all had gum disease but did not have diabetes.</p>
            <p style="background-color:powderblue;">At the end of the trial, researchers discovered participants given metformin had improved clinical outcomes in their gum disease treatment. Additionally, metformin helped control sugar levels and inflammation in the mouth and body, even when bacteria levels were high.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal"> Improving aging with metformin</h1>

            <p> “Prevention starts before disease takes place, with both my animal data and patient data showing good metformin outcomes even with high levels of bacteria in the mouth. This raises the question about whether ‘solely brushing your teeth’ truly is the only way we can actually prevent gum disease development throughout our lives,” Dr. Neves said.</p>
            <p> “In addition to those surprising findings, my clinical data also points to the potential use of metformin to improve the overall health of gum disease patients, due to seeing the stabilization of glucose levels, improvement of insulin sensitivity, and control of inflammation,” he added.</p>

            <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
                “All these markers [stabilized glucose, improved insulin, controlled inflammation] are directly correlated with improvement of aging according to aging research. Therefore, it seems that preventing systemic diseases from the mouth is a good pathway to prevent overall systemic diseases.”
                — Dr. Vitor Neves

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">  How does gum disease happen? </h1>
            <p>
                Periodontal disease happens when bacteria is allowed to collect onto teeth, forming a sticky substance called plaque.

                Most plaque can be removed with good dental hygiene — brushing teeth twice a day and flossing once a day. If plaque stays on the teeth too long, it can harden into a material called tartar, which can only be removed through professional dental cleaning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Plaque and tartar buildup on teeth can also inflame and infect the gums, leading to gingivitis.

                Suppose plaque and tartar are not removed from teeth and gingivitis is not treated. In that case, the infection can travel deeper into the soft tissues around teeth, potentially causing bone and tooth loss, known as periodontitis.
            </p>


            <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
                “If you go to the dentist today, the only possible treatment for gum disease is based on oral hygiene, cleaning the teeth, and antibiotic therapy, which are solely based on controlling plaque — bacteria and food — that accumulates around the teeth,” Dr. Neves told MNT.
