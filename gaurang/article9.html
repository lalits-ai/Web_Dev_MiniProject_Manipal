                Ultra-processed foods may be as addictive as smoking, study says
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Researchers say ultra-processed foods may be as addictive as smoking.</li>
                <li>They say these types of foods are high in refined carbohydrates and fats, substances that can cause changes in the brain.</li>
                <li>Experts say ultra-processed foods need to be more strictly regulated because of their potential addictive qualities and their impact on the obesity crisis.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>A recent studyTrusted Source published in The BMJ is reporting that ultra-processed foods can be as addictive as smoking.</p>
            <p>In their report, researchers say humans compulsively consume foods high in refined carbohydrates and added fats, which people find highly rewarding and appealing in ways similar to how they experience addictive substances such as nicotine.</p>
            <p>The researchers said some people eating these foods consume compulsively and that consumption may meet the criteria for diagnosis of substance use disorder in some people.</p>





            <h1 class="w3-text-teal"> Addiction and ultra processed foods</h1>

            <p>The study authors looked at an analysis of two systematic reviews that included 281 studies from 36 countries. From this data, the researchers reported that by the standards of the Yale Food Addiction Scale ultra-processed food addiction is estimated to occur in 14% of adults and 12% of children.</p>

            <p>For comparison, the study authors pointed out levels of addiction in other legal substances in adults are 14% for alcohol and 18% for tobacco. The level of 12 percent for children is “unprecedented,” the researchers noted.</p>

            <p>The Yale Food Addiction Scale assesses 11 symptomatic criteria for substance use disorder, including diminished control over intake, cravings, withdrawal, and continued use despite negative outcomes.</p>

            <p>The study authors also said ultra-processed foods are associated with “biopsychological mechanisms of addiction and clinically significant problems.”</p>

            <p>Among people with defined clinical diagnoses, the Yale Food Addiction Scale identified prevalence of food addiction reaches 32% in people with obesity who have bariatric surgery and more than 50% in those with binge eating disorder.</p>
            <p>Food addiction based on the Yale scale is also associated with core mechanisms of addiction, such as reward-related neural dysfunction, impulsivity, and emotion dysregulation, as well as poorer physical and mental health and lower quality of life.</p>







            <h1 class="w3-text-teal"> Why some foods can be addictive </h1>
            <p>While pointing out that not all food has addictive potential, the study authors identified types of food that can be addictive according to the Yale scale.</p>
            <p>These included foods with high levels of refined carbohydrates or added fats, such as sweets and salty snacks.</p>
            <p>Those are identified as food “most strongly implicated” as behavioral indicators of addiction, such as excessive intake, loss of control over consumption, intense cravings, and continued use despite negative consequences.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Addictive qualities of ultra-processed foods</h1>

            <p>The study authors said ultra-processed foods — industrially produced foods containing ingredients typically not available in home kitchens — are the main source of refined carbohydrates and added fats in the modern food supply.</p>
            <p>The combination of these refined carbohydrates and fats seems to have a supra-additive effect on brain reward systems, the study authors noted.</p>

            <p>The speed at which ultra-processed foods deliver carbohydrates and fats to the gut may also reflect their addictive potential. Drugs and routes of administration that affect the brain more quickly have a higher addictive potential, the research team said.</p>

            <p>Which is why a cigarette, which rapidly delivers nicotine to the brain, is more addictive than a slow-release nicotine patch.</p>

            <p>According to the study, additives may also contribute to the addictiveness of ultra processed foods, many of which have flavor additives increasing sweet and savory tastes. Additives meant to improve flavor include those found in cigarettes, sugar, cocoa, menthol, and alkaline salt.</p>

            <p>The authors acknowledged there are still unanswered questions. They also say specific ingredients found in cigarettes, such as tobacco, haven’t been found in possibly addictive food and refined carbohydrates and fats don’t act on reward systems directly, though “they seem to activate neural reward systems to a similar magnitude as nicotine and ethanol.”</p>
