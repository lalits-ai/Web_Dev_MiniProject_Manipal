                <h1 class="w3-text-teal">The pros and cons of using low-calorie diets to reverse diabetes</h1>

                <p>  Type 2 diabetes has become one of the most widespread health conditions worldwide. While medications can help people manage their symptoms, some medical experts suggest that lifestyle changes, such as following a low-calorie diet, can reverse this chronic condition. But are such changes always sustainable?</p>

                <p>
                    Around 96%Trusted Source of the estimated 537 million people around the world who have diabetes are living with type 2 diabetes. The number of people with diabetes is expected to riseTrusted Source to about 783 million by 2045.

                    While there is currently no cure for type 2 diabetes, its symptoms can be managed — and even reversed — through weight lossTrusted Source and lifestyle changes, such as exercisingTrusted Source more and following a healthy dietTrusted Source.

                    Recently, some scientists have focused on the use of a low-calorie diet as the answer to type 2 diabetes remission. However, some say following a low-calorie diet for the long term may not be feasible in the real world.

                    What exactly is a low-calorie diet? How could it help reverse type 2 diabetes? And is this type of diet appropriate for everyone with type 2 diabetes?

                    Medical News Today spoke with five medical experts on this subject to find out whether or not a low-calorie diet is the right move for people with type 2 diabetes.

                </p>
                <h1 class="w3-text-teal"> How are diet and type 2 diabetes related?  </h1>
                <p>
                    .Type 2 diabetes is a condition where the body can no longer use or produce insulin correctly. One of the main causes of type 2 diabetes is having overweight or obesity.

                    Because of type 2 diabetes’ ties to weight, most treatment options revolve around healthy lifestyle changes, including dietary changes.
                </p>

                <p style="background-color:powderblue;">  “Type 2 diabetes is a weight-related disorder in which people are not able to make enough insulin for their [bodies],” Dr. Jennifer Cheng, chief of endocrinology at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center explained to MNT. “They develop insulin resistance when gaining weight. The insulin goes into the fat tissue instead of their bloodstream. The improvement of glycemic control is related to weight loss.”  </p>


                <h1 class="w3-text-teal"> What is considered a low-calorie diet?  </h1>
                <p style="background-color:powderblue;"> The purpose of a low-calorie diet is to create a calorie deficit that can ultimately lead to weight loss. A consistent 500 to 1,000 calorie deficit can help a person lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.4–0.9 kilograms) per week.</p>
                <p> The Dietary Guidelines for AmericansTrusted Source suggest a healthy diet consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>focusing on fruits and vegetables for half of each meal</li>
                    <li>choosing whole grains and protein</li>
                    <li>selecting low-fat or fat-free dairy, lactose-free dairy, or fortified soy versions</li>
                    <li>limiting sodium, saturated fat, and sugar.</li>

                    <h1 class="w3-text-teal"> How could a low-calorie diet help reverse diabetes? </h1>

                    <p> Dr. Kathleen Axen, department chairperson and deputy chair graduate nutrition for Health and Nutrition Sciences at Brooklyn College, is the co-author of a studyTrusted Source on low-calorie diets and type 2 diabetes published in June 2021.</p>

                    <p style="background-color:powderblue;">According to her, because insulin resistance is a major feature of type 2 diabetes and weight loss reduces insulin resistance, that would be a way for a low-calorie diet to have put diabetes in remission.</p>
                    <p>
                        “Decreases in adipose tissue mass lower blood levels of free fatty acids, which would mitigate their effects on liver metabolism, allowing liver pathways to be more responsive to insulin,” she added. “Lower insulin resistance results in better control of blood glucose and blood lipids.”

                        Monique Richard, a registered dietitian nutritionist, owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, and national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition Dietetics, said if a person is decreasing their caloric intake, they are also decreasing the amount of carbohydrates they consume, which affects blood glucose levels.

                    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">  The Twin Cycle Hypothesis</h1>
                    <p>At the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes 2023, Dr. Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University in Newcastle, United Kingdom, spoke in support of a low-calorie diet leading to lasting remission of type 2 diabetes in a real-world setting.</p>

                    <p>
                        He told MNT that the proof for this can be found in a series of five major studies conducted in Newcastle that confirm the Twin Cycle HypothesisTrusted Source.

                        “The latter used our study data from studies on people with and without type 2 diabetes and predicted in 2008 that a period of low-calorie diet would sharply decrease the fat content of the liver,” Dr. Taylor explained.
                    </p>
                    <p style="background-color:powderblue;">
                        “That would bring benefits in two ways. It would improve the response to insulin and allow the body to return to normal the output of glucose from the liver. Crucially, it would return to normal the raised output of fat from the liver which was soaking all tissues of the body in excess fat, but the insulin-producing cells in particular would be suppressed by this.”
