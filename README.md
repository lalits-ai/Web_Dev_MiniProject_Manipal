# Web_Dev_MiniProject_Manipal
I and a team of 4 members had developed a mini project on "Apothecary Stewardship". 

Project Objective: The project's main objective is front-end development, and it is related to pharmaceutical or medical information, offering various tools. We have used Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript for all the pages. 
The project contains a landing page with multiple tools that can be accessed via the navigational bar or through the home page. It also has a Login/Sign Up page with all the necessary validations.

The tools include:
Pill Identifier
Interaction Checker
Home Remedies
Side Effects
Drugs Comparison
BMI Calculator

My contribution to the project was, I developed the Login/Signup page with all the validations using Bootstrap and custom JavaScript. 

And with the help of responsive design concepts, we made all the pages responsive. We used a mobile-first approach.

Also, we made the pages completely accessible to all users(disabled/Abled) using Assistive Technology concepts. We added custom JavaScript for screen readers.I and a team of 4 members had developed a mini project on "Apothecary Stewardship".
